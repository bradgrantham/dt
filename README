Send suggestions, etc. to vuori@sci.fi.

Quicky man page:
  Command-{1,2,3,...} changes virtual terminals
  Command-Shift-{1,2,3,...} change current VT to another display
  Command-F changes the font
  Command-O opens a new VT
  Command-P toggles pointer
  Command-X pastes the selected text
  Command-V pastes the copied text
  Command-C copies the selected text
  Command-{up-arrow,down-arrow} goes up/down one line at a time
  Command-{home,end} scrolls to the beginning/end of scrollback buffer
  Command-{pageup,pagedown} goes up/down a half page at a time
  F1...F12 configurable macro keys (see later in this file about .dtrc)
  F15 reloads your .dtrc

Set your $TERM to vt220 and unset $LINES.

Not tested on small or large (non-640x480) screens, etc.  All displays
must be in 1-bit mode.

The distribution binary has a fairly 'standard' configuration, which should
work on most machines. It uses the US keyboard layout. If you want to change
something, you should read the file CONFIG and change config.h accordingly.

IIsi note: if using option causes it to get 'stuck', you should define
LAME_OPTION and BROKED_ADB, if the console hangs after exiting dt.

You need a fairly recent netbsd kernel to run this and you need
to setup the following as root or in single-user mode if the files
'adb', 'grf0' and 'grf1' don't exist in /dev:

  # cd /dev
  # MAKEDEV adb
  # MAKEDEV grf0
  # MAKEDEV grf1

Note that the installer should have set this up for you.

If you exit a shell and it appears "hung", it is not hung.  Command-O
will open the VT again.  Exit desktop by exiting all of the shells.

Digraphs are now available, ie. umlaut + a produces a-umlaut (ä for 
the 8-bit clean). You might need to do stty -istrip so that the 8th
bit doesn't get stripped from input by the tty driver.

If you want dt to write utmp entries for the consoles, make it sgid to
group utmp:

 # chgrp utmp dt
 # chmod g+s dt

It's hopefully secure.

Beeps can be turned on/off by sending dt SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2, respectively.

Type "dt -h" for command-line options.

The following documentation is available:
 dt.txt		plaintext docs
 dt.ps		Postscript docs
 dt.html	html docs
They are all say basically say the same thing.

The .dtrc file
--------------
 This is a rather primitive control file for dt that allows you to specify
what the function keys do. Every line represents what a function key from 
1 to 12 should output, except for empty lines which do nothing and lines 
beginning with #, which mark the rest of the line as a comment.

 The file containing the macros should be called .dtrc and it should be placed
in your home directory. It is loaded on startup, and pressing F15 reloads it.

 An example .dtrc file, called 'example.dtrc', is included with the 
distribution.
