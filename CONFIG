Building dt
-----------
 You can either use the supplied binary or compile dt yourself.

 Since 1.0.1, there have been some configurable options in
the file config.h. If you want to change these, do it now.

LOGIN_SHELL - if this is defined, shells will be started as login shells
HIDE_MOUSE - hide the mouse on keyboard input
DEFAULT_NUMVT - number of vts to start initially (moved from main.c. this is a part of the original)
LAME_OPTION - if your option key seems to remain stuck after you use it, 
	define this. Otherwise don't, because it can create the problem 
	it's supposed to fix (happens on my IIsi) This is no longer needed 
	for -current kernels from June 30th 1995 or newer
OPTSET - if this is defined, alt and alt-shift produce whatever the keyboard 
	layout has in store for them. Otherwise alt just escapes the 
	character (1.0 behavior). If you use the Finnish layout, you'll 
	definitely want this defined
UTMP - if defined, utmp entries are written for the consoles. See README.
GRF_COMPAT - if you want to run dt on pre-July or so kernels, define this 
	(untested)
UNDERLINE - do real underlining instead of replacing underline with 
	bold (sorta slow)
BEEP - whether to sound beeps by default
MOUSE_ACCEL - mouse acceleration
INVERSE - white on black

Keyboard layouts

 Select one of the following in config.h:
FI_LAYOUT Finnish Extended keyboard
FR_LAYOUT French AppleDesign keyboard
US_LAYOUT US keyboard
GER_LAYOUT German keyboard

 Then just type 'make' and you should have a binary after it has compiled. 
If there's a problem, mail me, with a fix for it and/or a description of 
the problem.
