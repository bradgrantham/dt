 Changes to dt (desktop) since the epoch ...

0.00
----
 Initial release, that had pieces of it in the kernel

1.0
---
 Pulled out of the kernel, apparently last release by Lawrence and Brad

1.0.1 (5/16/1995)
-----
 Maintained by Valtteri Vuorikoski vuori@sci.fi from now on

- the deadlock when doing an xoff in the middle of output no longer occurs
- the mouse cursor disappears on keyboard input (and reappers when you move the mouse)
  like in MacOS
- when I used the option key, it seemed to remain down so all the characters were
  escaped. This is currently sorta-fixed. It escapes the one you want to escape and
  the next one too
- there's now actual signal handling
- the small font is always used for small screens now (< 1280 wide)
- revamped the Makefile
- included an alternate keyboard.h for Finnish keyboard layouts

1.0.2 (6/3/1995)
-----
- made underlining look like bold (there wasn't any before, so..)
- added vt220 codes for the pgup/pgdn/home/end keys
- changed configuration parameter CUSTOM_LAYOUT to FI_LAYOUT
- included uskeyboard.h and fikeyboard.h (finnish keyboard layout). Both have
  some added codes for command-keys and codes for alt and alt-shifted keys
- alt and alt-shifted keys can now be used for other things besides meta
  is OPTSET is defined
- copy/paste keys have changed. Command-X does the old-style paste-selection,
  Command-V pastes copied text and Command-C copies
- added an 8-bit 6x10 latin-1 font and support for it sure, and also bold 6x10 
  (with non-bold 8th bit, schumacher fonts only have the 7-bit set)
- changed the 8x14 font to a 8x13 latin-1 font
- made code 8-bit clean
- added function key macros and a .dtrc for specifying them
- added LAME_OPTION configuration option and code to fix machines on which
  option produces two keydowns instead of keydown-keyup (happens on my IIsi)

1.1 (7/25/1995)
---
- null characters are no longer sent except by control-space
- dt doesn't start and just put up an empty screen if no usable grf-devices
  are found but complains and exits instead
- utmp entries are now added for vts
- some keys were added to the finnish mapping and the umlaut to the us-mapping
  for maximum digraph enjoyment
- added MacOS-style digraphs
- the example .dtrc mentioned in the docs now exists
- pty[pqrs] are now used
- now using the new grf-device interface
- won't try to use grfs that aren't in 1-bit mode
- real underlining that's pretty inefficient
- minor micro-optimizations to grf.c and blit.c, mostly negated by the above
- implemented insert mode and something resembling reset terminal
- fixed command-home/end crashes
- it beeps
- added better-looking documentation than README. It's missing a few things,
  but still looks better than the README

1.1.1 (7/26/1995)
-----
- fixed missing {s when #undef UNDERLINE
- added signal descriptions to the new docs
- fixed wrong-grfioctl.h-included things

1.1.2 (7/27/1995)
-----
- fixed the wrong-grfioctl.h-included things for good

1.1.3 (1/11/1995)
-----
- fixed Makefile.prof and Makefile.debug trying to link with vers.h
- added some improvements to the digraph code, new digraphs and a 
  new uskeyboard.h with option and options-shifted maps. Thanks to
  Bill Studenmund <wrstuden@loki.stanford.edu> for these.
- OPTSET is now defined in the distribution binary/config.h by default
- updated the docs to include digraphs
- non-digraphable characters after digraph starters are now printed
  in addition to the digraph character (except for space)
- fix lack of text scrolling downwards in some cases in vi (from Francois
  Pays <francois@pluton.sema-itf.fr>)
- French AppleDesign keyboard layout (from Francois Pays 
  <francois@pluton.sema-itf.fr>)
- fix console hanging after exit
- fixed last column scrolling (from Francois Pays
  <francois@pluton.sema-itf.fr>)

1.1.4 (6/9/1996)
-----
- added mouse acceleration patch from Nakoruru <nakoruru@wam.umd.edu>
- C-- produces 0x1F, C-6 produces 0x1E
- version.sh -> ./version.sh in the Makefile for .-in-path-less-people
- changed the PRESENTATION #define to APPLICATION, made default (it's
  what the termcap has), changed kbd.c accordingly (it still sends
  ^[OA etc. like before, just the names changed)
- close the adb file descriptor when forking a shell
- quick fix for crashing on some screen sizes when mouse pointer is moved beyond
  the lower-right corner (see mux.c to enable it)
- inverted colors as an option (INVERSE) (with suggestions from M.R. Zucca
  <mrz5149@cs.rit.edu>)
- added a German keyboard layout from Hauke Fath
  <saw@sun0.urz.uni-heidelberg.de>

1.1.5 (11/12/1996)
-----
- add gerkeyboard.h to the cvs tree, actually have it in the package
- added USE_OLD_GRF to force using of old grf mapping interface for some
  problem cases with the new interface (SE/30 as of Nov 12 1996)

1.1.6
-----
- fix Makefile lossage
- apply patch to correct misuse of a static structure (from Bill Studenmund)
- update version number in utmp.h
- apply patch to allow specifying which grf device to use (from SUNAGAWA Keiki <kei_sun@ba2.so-net.or.jp>)
- frobbed uskeyboard.h to produce something-or-other control char with
  the correct key(s) (from Tom 'moof' Spindler <dogcow@stimpy.us.itd.umich.edu>)
